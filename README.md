2018 Implementation Study on Data Validation between Interoperability Platform and Plant Community


The ELIXIR Interoperability Platform has identified validation rules and supporting validation tools as an essential part of the infrastructure needed for the implementation of the Interoperability Platform. Validation is typically considered in a resource or component specific context. For example, archival databases have validation criteria for submissions embedded in their submission tools and data formats are validated by toolkits, some of which are open. Validation can also be retrospective for existing data as standards change and may be a part of a data release or curatorial process thus forming part of the data life cycle. However, these validation tools are often embedded in specific resource or archive implementations.

The rules for validation are not clearly described, implemented in an open service, or easily shared or extended. We therefore propose an implementation study to determine the requirements for validation with ELIXIR partners, to build prototype open validation services for archetype archival databases and knowledge bases.
